Task 1: Without using simulation, how would you choose the order number 𝑦𝑦 for these 52 weeks? Please explain your reason(s).


Task 2: Use receding horizon method to formulate and solve the problem. Clearly state any assumptions you might have made during the process.
How is this solution different from the one you obtained in Assignment 1? Is there any benefit using a variable order number 𝑦𝑦? 
Evidence this.


Task 3: Using receding horizon method requires the choosing of control and prediction horizons. How do these parameters affect your design?
Evidence this.


Task 4: Critically evaluate your work. Have you achieved the objectives? What problems did you find during this work?
What conclusions can you draw from your design? How would you improve your estimate/design? From the experience of this work, 
what do you need to consider when solving a practical problem?
